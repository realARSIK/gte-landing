## About

This is my first website, which I created back in 2023. At that time I was just starting to get familiar with web development: I was learning to layout layouts in HTML and CSS, trying simple animations in JavaScript. **My goal was to build a complete site with a unique design and an original concept.** Over time, the site evolved: I added GSAP animations and Swiper sliders, and then moved everything to Vite. Now **Great Trip to Egypt** remains for me a symbol of my first steps in web development and an example of how skills and approaches evolve over time.
